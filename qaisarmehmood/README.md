Chloropleth Map of New York showing the Population under age  5 in all New York counties for years 2010-2015 based on data from census.gov.
The goal is to identify the counties by a color scheme and showing the percentage of population in a specific county.According to the data from census.gov Jefferson County has the highest population and Hamilton county has the least amount of population.
