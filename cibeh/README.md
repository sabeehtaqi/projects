## Project

The purpose of this map is to create a pollution index report for all states within the United States. More precisely, the average daily emission of pollutant carbon monoxide (CO) is mapped in this presentation.

### Data

Project repository: https://github.com/umbcvis/projects/tree/master/cibeh

Data derived from: https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data

Data has been summarized and filtered to match the specification of this presentation.

### Instructional demo

This demo, adapted slighly from the [class 5 demo](https://umbcvis.github.io/classes/class-05), shows how to plot the GeoJSON data from the project repo.
